# PlusMinusGame

-Setting of the game:
An integer M (4 < M < 10) is taken as input from the user. An MxM table which consists of - signs is built. User inputs the amount and coordinates of the + signs to insert in the table.

-Goal and gameplay:
After the table is initialized, the goal of the game is to turn all + signs to - signs by targeting the squares. In this phase (named X phase), user inputs the coordinates of the target, and the sign of the target changes (- to + or + to -) along with the immediate squares in its diagonals. Game ends with victory when all signs are - or with user's input to exit the game.
